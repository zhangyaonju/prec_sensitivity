# precipitation sensitivity

This repository hosts the main code for generating the results for "Increasing sensitivity of dryland vegetation greenness to precipitation due to rising atmospheric CO2"

There are four folders under this repository
1. analysis presents the minimalistic model
2. DLM presents the dynamic linear model calculation for the GIMMS NDVI, LAI and MODIS NDVI.
3. MLR presents the multiple linear regression model for the GIMMS NDVI, MsTMIP models outputs.
4. prepare presents the preprocessing procedures for the satellite remote sensing data.
